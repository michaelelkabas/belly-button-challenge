# belly-button-challenge
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
In summary, this project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

# The features of the dashboard include

- Dropdown menu to select test subject ID number.
- Metadata panel displaying demographic information for the selected subject.
- Horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in the selected subject.
- Bubble chart displaying the OTU ID vs. sample values.

# The deployment of the dashboard is located as follows

The dashboard is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed https://github.com/michaelelkabas/belly-button-challenge/.
